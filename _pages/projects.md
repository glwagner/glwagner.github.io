## Squeeze dispersion

We identify a connection between large-scale oceanic strain and net mixing rates
that implies observations of oceanic turblence must be interpreted in
a larger context to properly appreciate their effect on net ocean mixing.

I've just submitted a [manuscript on Squeeze Dispersion][] to Geophysical Research Letters.


## Internal waves and currents

[Subsurface internal waves][] modify the physics of [quasi-geostrophic eddies][]
and turbulence on scales from 10 to 100 km ---
the ocean's version of storms and cyclones --- that play 
a crucial role in transporting heat and carbon from equator to pole and 
determining the ocean's density structure. The precise nature and importance
of these interactions in the Earth's ocean is poorly understood.


## [FourierFlows.jl][]

With [Navid Constantinou][], I am developing a code for solving 
solution of partial different equations in simple domains using
Fourier pseudospectral methods. The code intends to solve 
relatively small two-dimensional and modest three-dimensional
problems efficiently. Work is underway to use our code on
GPUs.
