## [Waves and flow][]

Subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies and currents --- quasi-geostrophic flow --- 
are the main components of oceanic motion on scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers.
Their particular dynamics, strength, and dissipation contols
how things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and drawn into the ocean's abyss. 
My past and continuing work uses theory, asymptotic models, and simple numerical simulations
to illuminate how waves and flow interact and exchange energy.
