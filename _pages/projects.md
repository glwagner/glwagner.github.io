## [Waves and flow][]

Subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies and currents are the 
main components of oceanic motion on scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers.
Their particular dynamics, strength, and dissipation contols
how things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My past and continuing work uses theory, asymptotic models, and simple numerical simulations
to illuminate the myriad ways that waves and flow interact and exchange energy.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

Salty, freezing cold water is poured into the ocean's abyss
when the ocean cools and new sea ice forms during
winter in Antarctica. This dense water creeps and spreads equatorward
to fill all the ocean basins, all the while gently stirred and 
mixed into the lighter water above by turbulence and breaking 
interior waves. The balance between these processes ultimately
determines the structure of oceanic density so critical to 
ocean dynamics, the storage and mixing of heat and carbon, 
and climate. My work in abyssal mixing uses, or will use, large 
numerical models to rationalize observations and chip away
at at the mystery of how the density stratification 
of the ocean somehow equilibrates as it gives rise to the same 
wave-driven turbulent processes that erode, mix, and homogenize it.
