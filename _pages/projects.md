## [Waves and flow][]

The peculiar dynamics of [subsurface internal waves][] and shifting eddies, 
currents, and '[quasi-geostrophic][]' flows each control, in their own way, how 
things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My work uses theory and idealized models to illuminate the multifold ways these
orthogonal, yet intertwined motions interact and coevolve.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

The ocean depths churn gently yet endlessly
on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. Over decades and centuries, these
turbulent motions conspire to pull heat and carbon
into the abyss, with profound implications for the evolution of Earth's 
climate and ocean stratification. My work in abyssal mixing uses a small amount 
of theory, "realistic" ocean models, and idealized high-resolution process studies
to probe both the origins and outcomes of turbulent abyssal mixing.
