## [Waves and flow][]

The peculiar dynamics of both subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies, 
currents, and 'quasi-geostrophic' flows each control, in their own way, how 
things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My work uses theory and idealized models to illuminate the multifold ways these
orthogonal, yet intertwined modes of motion *interact*, coevolve, and exchange energy.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

Far beneath the surface, the ocean is perpetually churned by weak, intermittent 
turbulence that over turns water on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. 
Gradually and not without mystery, this turbulent mixing draws heat and carbon 
into the abyss and ultimately sets the structure of oceanic density so critical
to how the ocean moves. My work in abyssal mixing uses large and "realistic"
numerical models to investigate the both the origins and outcomes
of turbulent mixing in the abyss.
