## [Waves and flow][]

The peculiar dynamics of both subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies, 
currents, and 'quasi-geostrophic' flows each control, in their own way, how 
things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My work uses theory and idealized models to illuminate the multifold ways these
orthogonal, yet intertwined modes of motion *interact and coevolve.*


## [Abyssal mixing][]

The dark abyssal depths of the ocean are gently but endlessly churned by turbulence 
on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. Gradually and mysteriously, this weak and
small-scale turbulence accumulates ocean-wide to draw heat and carbon into the 
abyss, with profound implications for the evolution of Earth's climate and
ocean stratification. My work in abyssal mixing uses a small amount of theory, 
"realistic" ocean models, and idealized high resolution processes studies
to probe both the origins and outcomes of turbulent abyssal mixing.
