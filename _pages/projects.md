## [Squeeze dispersion][]

We identify a connection between large-scale oceanic strain and net mixing rates
that implies observations of oceanic turblence must be interpreted in
a larger context to properly appreciate their effect on net ocean mixing.


[comment]: The density stratification and carbon content of the abyssal ocean is set
[comment]: by an equilibration between the formation of cold, salty bottom water
[comment]: in polar winters and mixing between this water and warmer, fresher waters 
[comment]: above by turbulence on millimeter to meter scales. The implication of this
[comment]: story is astounding: basically, the ocean and climate of Earth is 
[comment]: inextricably linked to ocean-churning turbulence on the smallest of scales.
[comment]: 
[comment]: Squeeze dispersion is a way through which large-scale ocean eddies and 
[comment]: currents interact --- motions on 10 to 100 km scales --- interact with 
[comment]: small-scale turbulence to *enhance* the rate at which things like heat
[comment]: and carbon mix in the vertical and into the abyssal ocean. We're calling this
[comment]: process *squeeze disperion* because it has to do with how eddies and currents
[comment]: squeeze (and stretch) fluid surfaces.


## [Waves and flow][]

[Quasi-geostrophic eddies][] and turbulence on scales from 10 to 100 km ---
the ocean's version of storms and cyclones --- play 
a crucial role in transporting heat and carbon from equator to pole and 
determining the density structure in the Southern Ocean. Theory and
idealized numerical simulations show that
[subsurface internal waves][] modify the dynamics of these quasi-geostorophic
eddies by extracting energy and transporting heat, carbon, and vorticity,
yet the role that waves play in ocean dynamics outside theoretical and 
idealized scenarios is largely unknown.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

The ocean depths churn gently yet endlessly
on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. Over decades and centuries, these
turbulent motions conspire to pull heat and carbon
into the abyss, with profound implications for the evolution of Earth's 
climate and ocean stratification. My work in abyssal mixing uses a small amount 
of theory, "realistic" ocean models, and idealized high-resolution process studies
to probe both the origins and outcomes of turbulent abyssal mixing.
