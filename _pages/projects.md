## [Squeeze dispersion][]

The density stratification and carbon content of the abyssal ocean is set
by an equilibration between the formation of cold, salty bottom water
in polar winters and mixing between this water and warmer, fresher waters 
above by turbulence on millimeter to meter scales. The implication of this
story is astounding: basically, the ocean and climate of Earth is 
inextricably linked to ocean-churning turbulence on the smallest of scales.

Squeeze dispersion is a way through which large-scale ocean eddies and 
currents interact --- motions on 10 to 100 km scales --- interact with 
small-scale turbulence to *enhance* the rate at which things like heat
and carbon mix in the vertical and into the abyssal ocean. We're calling this
process *squeeze disperion* because it has to do with how eddies and currents
squeeze (and stretch) fluid surfaces.


## [Waves and flow][]

The peculiar dynamics of [subsurface internal waves][] and shifting eddies, 
currents, and '[quasi-geostrophic][]' flows each control, in their own way, how 
things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My work uses theory and idealized models to illuminate the multifold ways these
orthogonal, yet intertwined motions interact and coevolve.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

The ocean depths churn gently yet endlessly
on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. Over decades and centuries, these
turbulent motions conspire to pull heat and carbon
into the abyss, with profound implications for the evolution of Earth's 
climate and ocean stratification. My work in abyssal mixing uses a small amount 
of theory, "realistic" ocean models, and idealized high-resolution process studies
to probe both the origins and outcomes of turbulent abyssal mixing.
