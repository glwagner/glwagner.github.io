## [Squeeze dispersion][]

We identify a connection between large-scale oceanic strain and net mixing rates
that implies observations of oceanic turblence must be interpreted in
a larger context to properly appreciate their effect on net ocean mixing.


## [Waves and flow][]

[Subsurface internal waves][] modify the physics of [quasi-geostrophic eddies][]
and turbulence on scales from 10 to 100 km ---
the ocean's version of storms and cyclones --- that play 
a crucial role in transporting heat and carbon from equator to pole and 
determining the ocean's density structure. The precise nature and importance
of these interactions in the Earth's ocean is poorly understood.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

The ocean depths churn gently yet endlessly
on centimeter to hundred-meter scales. Over decades and centuries, these
turbulent motions conspire to pull heat and carbon
into the abyss, with profound implications for the evolution of Earth's 
climate and ocean stratification. 


## [FourierFlows.jl][]

With [Navid Constantinou][], I am developing a code for solving 
solution of partial different equations in simple domains using
Fourier pseudospectral methods. The code intends to solve 
relatively small two-dimensional and modest three-dimensional
problems efficiently. Work is underway to use our code on
GPUs.
