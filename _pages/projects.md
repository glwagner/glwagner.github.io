### Turbulent surface boundary layers

I am working on developing models for turbulence in the ocean's
surface boundary layer with 'optimized' and uncertainty-quantified
parameters. 
This work is part of the [CliMa] project.

### Squeeze dispersion

Squeeze dispersion is a phenomenon by which the dispersion of tracers
is enhanced in the presence of fluctuating strain. 

![Squeezing](https://glwagner.github.io/assets/figures/squeezing.pdf)

As a result the average diffusivity underestimates the 'true' effective diffusivity
of oceanic tracers.

This process is important in systems where mixing is inherently diffusive, 
including, for example, the vertical mixing of heat and carbon in the Earth's ocean.

### Internal waves and currents

[Subsurface internal waves] modify the physics of [quasi-geostrophic eddies]
and turbulence on scales from 10 to 100 km ---
the ocean's version of storms and cyclones --- that play 
a crucial role in transporting heat and carbon from equator to pole and 
determining the ocean's density structure. The precise nature and importance
of these interactions in the Earth's ocean, and the role that waves
play in transporting oceanic tracers, is poorly understood.

### [Oceananigans.jl]

[Oceananigans.jl] is a fast and friendly solver for the direct
and large eddy simulation of ocean-relevant
fluids problems in julia.
I contribute to the development of [Oceananigans.jl] as
part of the [CliMa] project.
I use and develop Oceananigans.jl to study turbulent mixing in the
ocean surface boundary layer.

### [FourierFlows.jl] 

[FourierFlows.jl] is [julia] software that solves 'small' 2D fluid 
dynamics problems on CPUs and GPUs. I am developing FourierFlows.jl
with [Navid Constantinou].
