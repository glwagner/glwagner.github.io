## [Waves and flow][]

Subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies and currents --- quasi-geostrophic flow --- 
are the main components of oceanic motion on scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers.
The particular dynamics, strength, and dissipation of these motions imprints on 
how things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and drawn into the ocean's abyss. 
I am studying how waves and flow interact and exchange energy 
by developing and solving new theoretical models for their nonlinear and coupled evolution.
