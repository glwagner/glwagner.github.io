## [Waves and flow][]

Far below the surface, hidden from the searching eyes of plane passengers and beachwalkers, 
the ocean moves. Some of this motion oscillates with clock-like regularity on cycles of 24 hours, 
or 12.421 hours, or even the peculiar period of $$4 \pi \sin \phi / day$$ at latitudes $$\phi$$: 
these are subsurface internal waves. On even longer time scales of days to weeks, 
narrow jet-like currents like the Gulf Stream and storm-like eddies spin and shift: this is flow. 


During my PhD and continuing now, I am studying how waves and flow interact and exchange energy 
by developing and solving new theoretical models for their nonlinear and coupled evolution.
