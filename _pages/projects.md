## [Waves and flow][]

Subsurface internal waves and shifting eddies and currents are the 
main components of oceanic motion on scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers.
Their particular dynamics, strength, and dissipation contols
how things like heat and carbon are stirred, mixed, and stored in the ocean's abyss. 
My past and continuing work uses theory, asymptotic models, and simple numerical simulations
to illuminate the myriad ways that waves and flow interact and exchange energy.


## [Abyssal mixing][]

Salty, freezing cold water is poured into the ocean's abyss
when the ocean cools and new sea ice forms during
winter in Antarctica. This dense water creeps and spreads equatorward
to fill all the ocean basins, all the while gently 
mixed into the lighter water above by turbulence and breaking 
interior waves. The balance between these processes ultimately
determines the structure of oceanic density so critical to how
the ocean moves, mixes, and stores heat and carbon.
My work in abyssal mixing uses large and "realistic"
numerical models to investigate how how turbulent mixing 
both depends on and erodes the ocean's density stratification.
