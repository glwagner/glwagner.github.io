## [Waves and flow][]

Far below the surface, hidden from the searching eyes of plane passengers and beachwalkers, 
the ocean moves. Some of this motion oscillates with clock-like regularity on cycles of 24 hours, 
or 12.421 hours, or even the peculiar period of 4 \pi \sin \phi / day at latitudes \phi: these are waves.
These subsurface internal waves are generated by storms and tides at huge, hundred kilometer scales, 
and propagate across ocean basins. On even longer time scales of days to weeks, narrow jet-like currents
like the Gulf Stream and storm-like eddies spin and shift: this is flow. Flow is forced on long
time-scales by the wind and uneven transfers of heat between the atmosphere and ocean. 

During my PhD and continuing now, I am studying how waves and flow interact and exchange energy 
by developing and solving new theoretical models for their nonlinear and coupled evolution.
