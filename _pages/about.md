I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth. 

As a scientist I study the Earth's ocean, its physics and motion, and
the infinite entanglement of its eddies, currents, waves, and turbulence.

Long ago, I was raised in a suburb outside of Boston, Massachusetts. 
I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan to pursue an undergraduate degree in 
Aerospace Engineering, where I worked on combustion in porous media, 
space propulsion, and wind energy. 
I moved to San Diego for my PhD, working with [Eric Lauga][] 
on locomotion, with Bill Young on nonlinear waves and with both 
on microorganism mixing before receiving my PhD in May of 2016 for a 
[dissertation][] titled "On the coupled 
evolution of oceanic internal waves and quasi-geostrophic flow".
Along the way, I fell in love with running, rock climbing, and 
backcountry skiing.

I moved back to Boston in the fall of 2017 to start postdoctoral research 
at MIT, where I've been working on abyssal mixing, parameterization of 
oceanic processes, large eddy simulation, and ice climbing.

If I'm not answering email, I may be somewhere beyond the end of the road, 
exploring this wonderful planet...
