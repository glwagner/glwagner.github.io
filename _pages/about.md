I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth. 

As a scientist I study the physics of the Earth's ocean and the
infinite entanglement of its eddies, currents, waves, and turbulence.

I'm currently working with [Raffaele Ferrari][] at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology under [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship][] 
to examine how the patterns and physics of [bottom-enhanced ocean turbulence][] 
transfer heat and carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean abyss.

## More generally

I was raised in a Boston suburb and shaped by western landscapes.  After 
receiving Bachelors and Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the 
University of Michigan, I entered a PhD program in the Mechanical and 
Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego 
in the fall of 2011.  I worked with [Eric Lauga][] for a few years on problems 
in locomotion and *very* small-scale fluid dynamics before switching to 
oceanography and [Bill Young][] when Eric accepted a position at the University 
of Cambridge. 

I received my PhD in May of 2016 for a [dissertation][] titled "On the coupled 
evolution of oceanic internal waves and quasi-geostrophic flow".  In my 
dissertation I use asymptotic mathematical methods and simple computer 
simulations to unearth oceanic truths about [ever-changing currents][] 
and [subsurface internal waves][] with scales between 10 and 200 kilometers.
