I am a human and a scientist.  I love to learn and to teach,
to think about past and future, and to run, climb, ski, and explore 
the landscapes of Earth.  Through science I try to better understand 
the Earth's ocean and why it moves in such mysterious ways.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego in May 2016
for a dissertation titled "On the coupled evolution of oceanic internal waves
and quasi-geostrophic flow".  In my dissertation I use asymptotic mathematical 
methods and simple computer simulations to unearth oceanic truths about 
[ever-changing currents][] and [subsurface internal waves][] with scales 
between 10 and 200 kilometers.

I'm now a [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow][] working with 
[Raffaele Ferrari][] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on 
[bottom-enhanced ocean turbulence][] and how its particular distribution and 
physics control heat and carbon transport from the atmosphere into the ocean 
abyss.

I've also worked on the mechanics of granular flow, stratified and unstratified 
low Reynolds number flow, and friction-based locomotion.
