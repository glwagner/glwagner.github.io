I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth. 

As a scientist I study the Earth's ocean, its physics and motion, and
the infinite entanglement of its eddies, currents, waves, and turbulence.

I'm currently working with [Raffaele Ferrari][] in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
funded by a [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship][] 
to examine how the patterns and physics of [bottom-enhanced ocean turbulence][] 
transfer heat and carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean abyss.

## More generally

I was raised in a Boston suburb. After receiving Bachelors and Masters degrees 
in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan, I entered a PhD 
program in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the University 
of California, San Diego in the fall of 2011.  I worked with [Eric Lauga][] for 
a few years on problems in locomotion and *very* small-scale fluid dynamics before 
zooming out to oceanic fluid dynamics with [Bill Young][] after Eric accepted a 
position at the University of Cambridge. 

I received my PhD in May of 2016 for a [dissertation][] titled "On the coupled 
evolution of oceanic internal waves and quasi-geostrophic flow".  In my 
dissertation I use asymptotic mathematical methods and simple computer 
simulations to unearth oceanic truths about [ever-changing currents][] 
and [subsurface internal waves][] with scales between 10 and 200 kilometers.

Then I took a few months off, traveled and climbed mountains, and eventually
ended up back in Boston where I started long ago.
