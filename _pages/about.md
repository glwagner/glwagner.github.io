# About me

I am a human and a scientist.  I love to learn and to teach,
to think about past and future, and to run, climb, ski, and explore 
the landscapes of Earth.  Through science I try to better understand 
the Earth's ocean and why it moves in such mysterious ways.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego in May 2016
for a dissertation titled "On the coupled evolution of oceanic internal waves
and quasi-geostrophic flow".  In my dissertation I use asymptotic
mathematical methods and simple computer simulations to unearth
oceanic truths about [ever-changing currents](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eddy.html)
and [subsurface internal waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_wave)
with scales between 10 and 200 kilometers.

I'm now a [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow]
(http://vsp.ucar.edu/cgc/current-awards-alumni) working with
[Raffaele Ferrari](http://ferrari.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on bottom-enhanced ocean turbulence and how its
[particular distribution and physics](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7517/full/513179a.html)
control heat and carbon transport from the atmosphere into the ocean abyss.
