I study the Earth's ocean, its physics and motion, and
the infinite entanglement of its eddies, turbulence, currents, and waves.
I do a lot of math, write code that runs on supercomputers, and 
very occasionally go to [sea].
I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth.

**Long ago**, I spent most of my childhood in a [suburb 
outside Boston, Massachusetts][wellesley]. 
Sometime later, I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan to pursue an undergraduate 
degree in Aerospace Engineering. 
There I worked on combustion in porous 
media, space propulsion, and wind energy. 
I moved to San Diego to pursue a PhD in 2010, working with [Eric Lauga]
on locomotion, with [Bill Young] on nonlinear waves and with both 
on microorganism mixing.
I received a PhD from UCSD in May of 2016 for a 
[dissertation] titled 
[*On the coupled evolution of oceanic internal waves and quasi-geostrophic flow*][proquest].
Along the way, I fell in love with [running], [climbing], 
[backcountry skiing], and [surfing].

I moved back to Boston in November 2016 to start postdoctoral research 
at [MIT][office], where I've been working on ocean mixing, [parameterization of 
oceanic processes][clima], [large eddy simulation], and [ice climbing].

If I'm not answering email, I may be somewhere beyond the end of the road, 
exploring this wonderful planet...
