A remarkable aspect of ocean physics are the pulsating
waves that oscillate around the ocean's density stratification
and rotation and, borne on daily-changing currents and pressure
fluctuations, criss-cross the ocean basins. Though these waves are
by nature slight perturbations to the ocean's background state,
their strength is sufficient to alter and affect both heat-transpoting
eddies and currents, and the diapycnal mixing that determines
the ocean's density stratification.

More coming soon.
