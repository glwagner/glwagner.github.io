title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher funded by a [NOAA fellowship][] 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I study the physics
of ocean flows.

My research is motivated by fundamental questions in fluid dynamics,
ocean physics, and ultimately Earth science. For example,
what determines the ocean's density structure?
How does the ocean transport heat from equator to pole?
How does the deep ocean respond to changes in atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide and heat?

I confront these questions as a theorist, which means I seek a sometimes
ill-defined, yet crucial "understanding" of physical
processes. For example, rather than providing a definitive answer on
the rate at which the deep ocean changes, I want to explain *why* the 
deep ocean changes the way it does.

I've recently submitted a [manuscript][] to Geophysical Research Letters on a newly-identified process called
'Squeeze dispersion' that affects the deep mixing of carbon and heat.
