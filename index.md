title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I study physics and write software with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] to build 
the ocean component for a new earth system model.

My research interests include modeling ocean turbulence at large and small
scales, geophysical fluid dynamics, and software design strategies that make
ocean modeling as easy and as accessible as possible.
