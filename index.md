title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I'm currently working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] to build 
the ocean component for a new earth system model.
I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [NOAA Climate and Global
Change program] from 2016--2018.

Something I've been working on lately is a piece of julia
software called `OceanTurb.jl` for prototyping 
one-dimensional models of the ocean surface boundary layer. 
Check out [`OceanTurb.jl` on github](https://github.com/glwagner/OceanTurb.jl).

I study the Earthâ€™s ocean, its physics and motion, 
and the infinite entanglement of its eddies, currents, waves, 
and turbulence. My work is motivated by basic questions in 
fluid dynamics and ocean physics. For example:
what sets the density structure of the ocean?
I use applied mathematics, computations, and observations
to seek reduced models, simplifications, and explanations
for complex oceanic phenomena.
