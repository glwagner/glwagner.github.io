title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at MIT in the department of 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences][].
I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance][] to build a new
Earth System model. My job is to improve the ocean model,
and to code a little [Julia][] along the way.

More generally, I seek answers to fundamental questions in fluid 
dynamics and ocean physics. For example: what sets the density
structure of the oceanic surface layer? I confront these questions 
primarily as a theorist, and occasionally draw on computations or observations.

I've recently submitted a [manuscript][] to Geophysical Research Letters on a
newly-identified process called 'Squeeze dispersion' that affects the deep mixing 
of carbon and heat.
