title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

I'm interested in ocean physics, waves, turbulence, mixing,
and software design that empowers scientists and makes ocean modeling 
as accessible as possible.

Lately I've been working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] 
to build the ocean component for a new earth system model.
In this adventure I've lead the development of the popular
ocean-flavored fluid dynamics software [Oceananigans], started
development of a new sea ice model [ClimaSeaIce],
and worked on turbulent mixing parameterization,
wave-turbulence interaction, sea ice thermodynamics, air-sea flux parameterization,
and more.
