title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

With the [Climate Modeling Alliance], I'm working on building the
ocean and sea ice components for a new, trainable climate model
with quantified uncertainty.
Our new model is radical departures from existing models in some ways --- it's written
in the Julia programming language and runs on GPUs.
In some other ways, it's not so different from the traditional climate models that
have been around for decades.

My work includes research in physical processes, parameterization,
as well as software development.
I lead the development of the popular, fast, and flexible
ocean-flavored fluid dynamics software [Oceananigans],
the sea ice modeling software [ClimaSeaIce],
and have research efforts in turbulent mixing parameterization,
surface-wave-turbulence interaction, sea ice thermodynamics,
air-sea flux parameterization, and more.
