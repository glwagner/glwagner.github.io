title: Me: human and scientist
---

I study the physics of ocean flows.  

I'm a postdoctoral researcher funded by a [NOAA fellowship][] 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
I'm interested in how the ocean's subsurface landscape 
--- mountains, corrugated ridges, canyons, and rolling hills --- 
modulates turbulence that mixes heat and carbon on the smallest scales.
