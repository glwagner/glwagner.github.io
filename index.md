title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I'm currently working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] to build 
the ocean component for a new earth system model.
I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [NOAA Climate and Global
Change program] from 2016--2018.

Lately my work has branched into two main efforts: software development, 
and the development of parameterizations and turbulence models for ocean general circulation 
and climate models. In software, I've been writing a lot of [julia](https://julialang.org) 
code: a GPU code for large eddy simulation called 
[`Oceananigans.jl`](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl),
software for prototyping one-dimensional models of the ocean surface boundary layer called 
[`OceanTurb.jl`](https://github.com/glwagner/OceanTurb.jl),
and a framework for developing pseudospectral partial differential equation solvers 
for CPUs and GPUs called [`FourierFlows.jl`](https://github.com/FourierFlows).
I'm particularly interested in designing high-performance software for
computational physics and oceanography that maximizes the productivity of scientists, 
increases scientific reproducibility, and makes science more accessible, understandable, 
and communicable.

More generally, I study the Earthâ€™s ocean, its physics and motion, 
and the infinite entanglement of its eddies, currents, waves, 
and turbulence. My work is motivated by basic questions in 
fluid dynamics and ocean physics. For example:
how are heat, salt, and momentum transported in stratified turbulence?
Or: how is energy transferred across the vast range of scales of oceanic motion?
I use mostly applied mathematics and computations, and occasionally observations
to seek reduced models, simplifications, and explanations for complex oceanic phenomena.
