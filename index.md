title: Me: human and scientist
---

I study the physics of ocean flows.  

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institue of 
Technology trying to understand how the ocean's subsurface "landscape"
--- underwater mountains and volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, canyons, 
and rolling hills --- modulates the turbulence that mixes the 
ocean on the smallest scales.  My work is funded by a [NOAA postdoctoral
fellowship][].
