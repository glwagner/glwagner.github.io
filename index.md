title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] (CliMA) to build a
new, trainable climate model with quantified uncertainty.

My work aims both to better understand the world, and to improve the fidelity of ocean and climate simulations.
My science investigates turbulence dynamics and mixing, wave-mean interaction, near-surface processes, and improves the representation of ocean and sea ice processes in large-scale models.
In software, I lead the development of CliMA's [ocean component](ClimaOcean), CliMA's [sea ice component](ClimaSeaIce),
and the ground-breaking ocean modeling software they are based on, [Oceananigans].
Oceananigans is written for GPUs in the high-level [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/): at once highly productive, easy to develop, and 10-50x faster than existing software.
