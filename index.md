title: Me: human and scientist
---

I am a human, scientist, physical oceanographer, and postdoctoral researcher 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I received a PhD from the 
University of California, San Diego in May, 2016 and moved to Boston in 
November.

At MIT I'm working on problems in ocean mixing and turbulence.
I'm especially interested in how the ocean's "landscapes" --- underwater 
mountains and volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, canyons, and rolling hills ---
shape the turbulence that mixes heat and carbon into the abyss.
