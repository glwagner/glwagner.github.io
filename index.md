title: Me: human and scientist
---

I am a human, scientist, physical oceanographer, and postdoctoral researcher at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  

Much of my time at MIT is spend working on problems in ocean mixing and turbulence.
I'm especially interested in how underwater bathyscapes --- mountains and volcanoes, 
mid-ocean ridges, canyons, and vast regions of rolling hills --- affect the small-scale
turbulence that churns heat and carbon into the deep ocean.

me and what I do, or email me at `wagner.greg@gmail.com`.
