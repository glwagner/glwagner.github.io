title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm head of Numerical Weather Prediction at [Aeolus Labs] and a research scientist
in [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I develop differentiable software that plies the region between physics and machine learning.
I also dabble in fluid dynamics, physics, and Earth system modeling.
Writ large, my goal is to accelerate progress in Earth system science by making simulations
of the Earth system easier, cheaper, and more accurate.

At Aeolus, I'm leading a team to build a differentiable,
physics-based, GPU-first atmosphere model based on [Oceananigans].
Our goal is to enable ultra-high-resolution physics+ML weather prediction and hurricane science.
The new model is called [Breeze].
