title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

With the [Climate Modeling Alliance], I'm working on building the
ocean and sea ice components for a new, trainable climate model with quantified uncertainty.

My work includes research in physical processes, parameterization,
as well as software development.
I lead the development of the popular, fast, and flexible
ocean-flavored fluid dynamics software [Oceananigans],
the sea ice modeling software [ClimaSeaIce],
and have research efforts in turbulent mixing parameterization,
surface-wave-turbulence interaction, sea ice thermodynamics,
air-sea flux parameterization, and more.
