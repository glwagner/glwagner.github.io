title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher funded by a [NOAA fellowship][] 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I study the physics
of ocean flows. 

My research is motivated by fundamental questions in ocean physics 
and ultimately Earth science.
For example,
"What determines the ocean's density structure?"
"How does the ocean transport heat from equator to pole?"
"How does the deep ocean respond to changes in atmospheric 
heat content and carbon dioxide concentration?"

I confront these questions as a theorist, which means I seek an 
ill-defined yet crucial "understanding". Rather than providing
definitive answers on, for example, the rate at which the deep ocean
changes, I seek to explain *why* the deep ocean changes the way it does.
