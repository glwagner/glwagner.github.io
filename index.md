title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at MIT.
I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] to build 
the ocean component for a new Earth System model.

I seek answers to fundamental questions in fluid 
dynamics and ocean physics. For example: what sets the density
structure of the oceanic surface layer? 
I use applied mathematics, computations, and observations
to seek reduced models, simplifications, and explanations
for complex oceanic phenomena.
