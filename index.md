title: Me: human and scientist
---

Hello!  I am a physical oceanographer and postdoctoral researcher at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I'm working on several problems
in oceanic mixing, turbulence, internal waves, and the interaction of 
oceanic flows with underwater mountains, canyons, and otherwise rough
bathymetry.  Please feel free to explore this site to learn more about
me and what I do, or email me at `wagner.greg@gmail.com`.
