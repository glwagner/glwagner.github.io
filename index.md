title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm the head of numerical weather prediction at [Aeolus Labs] and a research scientist in [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I develop differentiable software that plies the region between physics and machine learning, while dabbling in fluid dynamics, physics, and Earth system modeling.
Writ large, my goal is to accelerate progress in Earth system science by making simulations of Earth system cheaper, easier, and more accurate.

At Aeolus, I'm leading a team to build a differentiable, physics-based, GPU-first atmosphere model
for ultra-high-resolution hybrid physics/ML weather prediction and hurricane modeling based on [Oceananigans].
