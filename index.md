title: Me: human and scientist
---

I study the physics of ocean flows.  

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. I'm interested in how the ocean's subsurface landscape 
--- mountains, corrugated ridges, canyons, and rolling hills --- 
modulates turbulence that mixes heat and carbon on the smallest scales.  
My work is funded by a [NOAA postdoctoral fellowship][].
