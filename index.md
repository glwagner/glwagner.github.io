title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm the head of Numerical Weather Prediction at [Aeolus Labs] and a research scientist
in [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I develop Earth system modeling software that plies the region between physics and machine learning
and dabble in fluid dynamics.
My goal is to accelerate progress in Earth system science by making simulations
of the Earth system easier, cheaper, and more accurate.

At Aeolus, I'm leading a team to build a differentiable,
physics-based, GPU-first atmosphere model based on [Oceananigans].
Our goal is to enable ultra-high-resolution physics+ML weather prediction and hurricane science.
The new model is called [Breeze].
