title: Me: human and scientist
---

I am a human, scientist, physical oceanographer, and postdoctoral researcher 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  I received a PhD from the 
University of California, San Diego in May, 2016 and moved to Boston in 
November.

At MIT I'm working on problems in ocean mixing and turbulence.
I'm especially interested in how underwater bathyscapes --- mountains and 
volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, canyons, and rolling hills --- affect the 
small-scale turbulence that churns heat and carbon into the deep ocean.

me and what I do, or email me at `wagner.greg@gmail.com`.
