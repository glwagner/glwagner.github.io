title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

I'm interested in ocean physics, waves, turbulence, mixing,
and software design that empowers scientists and makes ocean modeling 
as accessible as possible.
I'm currently working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] 
to build the ocean component for a new earth system model.
