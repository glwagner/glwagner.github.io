title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I'm studying physics, writing software, and building the ocean
component for a new earth system model with the [Climate Modeling Alliance].

My research interests include modeling ocean turbulence at large and small
scales, geophysical fluid dynamics, and software design that 
empowers scientists and makes ocean modeling as accessible as possible.
