title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].

I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] (CliMA) to build a
new, trainable Earth System model with quantified uncertainty.

I lead the development of [Oceananigans], as well as CliMA's [ocean component](ClimaOcean) and [sea ice component](ClimaSeaIce).
Our approach, which is detailed in our [preprint](oceananigans-paper), is to marry ground-breaking software design for modeling with simple numerical methods that are compatible with machine learning optimized for high resolution simulations on GPUs.
The result is clear, accessible, understandable, high performance code increases the productivity of scientists and model developers, and ultimately aims to accelerate progress in Earth system science.

I also study turbulence and mixing, waves, near-surface processes, and the approximate representation of ocean and sea ice processes in numerical simulations.
