title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a research scientist in [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at [MIT].
I'll also be starting a new position very soon as the head of numerical weather prediction at [Aeolus Labs].
I develop differentiable software that plies the region between physics and machine learning.
I also dabble in fluid dynamics, physics, and Earth system modeling.
Writ large, my goal is to accelerate progress in Earth system science by making simulations of the Earth system cheaper, easier, and more accurate.

At Aeolus, I'll be leading a team to build a differentiable, physics-based, GPU-first atmosphere model based on [Oceananigans].
Our goal is to enable ultra-high-resolution physics+ML weather prediction and hurricane science.
The new model is called [Breeze].
