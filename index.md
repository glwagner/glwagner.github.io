title: Me: human and scientist
---

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in 
[Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences] at MIT.
I'm working with the [Climate Modeling Alliance] to build 
the ocean component for a new Earth System model.

### My work

I seek answers to fundamental questions in fluid 
dynamics and ocean physics. For example: what sets the density
structure of the oceanic surface layer? 
I use applied mathematics and computations --- and observations from time to time --- 
to seek explanations, simplifications, or reduced models for complex oceanic phenomena.
